Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains some projects that I have executed. Please feel free to look around let me know if you have any questions!

## [Rideshare Analysis (SQL)](https://github.com/L-michelle/Projects/tree/main/Rideshare%20Analysis%20(SQL))
* Parsed data from website to obtain Chicago weather in November of 2017
* Analyzed data using SQL and python to find patterns 
* Used EDA to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides such as weather
* Tested hypothesis on whether the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport differs on rainy Saturdays

## [City Bike Lane](https://github.com/L-michelle/SQL-Projects/blob/main/City%20Bike%20Lanes)
This dataset has information about local bike lanes such as the street name they're on, the year they were first installed, the year they were updated, how wide they are, and their safety rating.
* Checked for duplicates in dataset and found that two technicians gave differing ratings for each street
* Analyzed safety ratings and classified average safety ratings of >=4 as safe
* Used windows functions to classify recommendations based on average safety ratings
* Counted total number of projects per street based on classifications
