* Parsed data from website to obtain Chicago weather in November of 2017
* Analyzed data using SQL and python to find patterns 
* Used EDA to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides such as weather

## [Data Analyst Jobs](https://github.com/L-michelle/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20Jobs)
* Analyzed data analyst job postings in US from 2022-2023 with focus on remote jobs, California jobs, and jobs in and surround Irvine.
* Used PostgreSQL, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize findings.
* Found that most remote jobs were from recruiters and suggested to focus on smaller companies as well as apply to job listings posted by the actual company themselves.

## [City Bike Lane](https://github.com/L-michelle/SQL-Projects/blob/main/City%20Bike%20Lanes)
This dataset has information about local bike lanes such as the street name they're on, the year they were first installed, the year they were updated, how wide they are, and their safety rating.
* Checked for duplicates in dataset and found that two technicians gave differing ratings for each street
* Analyzed safety ratings and classified average safety ratings of >=4 as safe
* Used windows functions to classify recommendations based on average safety ratings
* Counted total number of projects per street based on classifications
