# SQL Projects
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains some projects that I have executed. Please feel free to look around let me know if you have any questions!

## Rideshare Analysis

For this project, I worked as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. I analyzed the data using SQL and python to find patterns in the available information. I also wanted to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. I studied a database, analyzed data from competitors, and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## [Customer and Order Analytics](https://github.com/L-michelle/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Customer%20and%20Order%20Analytics) 
This project contains a quick analysis on orders. Questions answered included how many orders were placed in January, how many of those orders were iPhones, the minimum product price, and total revenue.
